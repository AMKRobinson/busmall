As a focus group user I want to have clear instructions as to what I am supposed to do on the page.
As a focus group user I want an attractive interface.

As a developer I want the user to express their interest in 1 of 3 product images on the page by
clicking each one. I want 3 randomly generated images to replace the previous 3 images and not have
them include any of the previous ones. I want this process to complete after 25 cycles and I want a
list displayed containing the number of clicks per image.
As a developer I want to receive the total amount of user selections per product.
